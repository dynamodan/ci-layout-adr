CodeIgniter Layout ADR

This is a collection of my common CodeIgniter layouts, along with a templating hook called Layout.php.  "ADR" is an acronym that means "Above Doc Root" because in my opinion, php frameworks should always live above (or perhaps more correctly, outside) the apache document root.

I've used these on many, many projects and most of the files and concepts originally come from the CodeIgniter Forums.
